## Features

### Type safety

The created mock matches the mocked type so all expectations are type safe. Moreover, refactorings in an IDE will also cover your expectations.

### Useful error messages

Error messages include the property that has been accessed, any arguments passed to it and any remaining unmet expectations.

```typescript
import { mock, when } from 'strong-mock';

const fn = mock<(a: number, b: number, c: number) => number>();

when(() => fn(1, 2, 3)).thenReturn(42);

fn(4, 5, 6);
```

### Type safe argument matchers

Optional argument matchers allow you to create complex expectations, while still maintaining type safety.

## Installation

```shell
npm i -D strong-mock
```

```shell
yarn add -D strong-mock
```

## Requirements

strong-mock requires an environment that supports the [ES6 Proxy object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). This is necessary to create dynamic mocks from types because TypeScript does not support reflection i.e. exposing the type info at runtime.

## API

### Setting expectations

Expectations are set by calling the mock inside a `when` callback and finishing it by setting a return value.

```typescript
when(() => foo.bar(23)).thenReturn('awesome');
```

### Setting multiple expectations

You can set as many expectations as you want by calling `when` multiple times. If you have multiple expectations with the same arguments they will be consumed in the order they were created.

```typescript
when(() => foo.bar(23)).thenReturn('awesome');
when(() => foo.bar(23)).thenReturn('even more awesome');

console.log(foo.bar(23)); // awesome
console.log(foo.bar(23)); // even more awesome
```

By default, each call is expected to be called only once. You can expect a call to be made multiple times using the [invocation count](#setting-invocation-count-expectations) helpers.

### Setting invocation count expectations

You can expect a call to be made multiple times by using the invocation count helpers `between`, `atLeast`, `times`, `anyTimes` etc.:

```typescript
const fn = mock<(x: number) => number>();

when(() => fn(1)).thenReturn(1).between(2, 3);

console.log(fn(1)); // 1
console.log(fn(1)); // 1
console.log(fn(1)); // 1
console.log(fn(1)); // throws because the expectation is finished
```

### Mocking interfaces

Pass in the interface to the generic argument of `mock`:

```typescript
interface Foo {
  bar: (x: number) => string;
  baz: number;
}

const foo = mock<Foo>();

when(() => foo.bar(23)).thenReturn('awesome');
when(() => foo.baz).thenReturn(100);

console.log(foo.bar(23)); // 'awesome'
console.log(foo.baz); // 100
```

Since the mock is type safe the compiler will guarantee that you're only mocking things that actually exist on the interface.

### Mocking functions

You can also mock functions similarly to interfaces:

```typescript
type Fn = (x: number) => number;

const fn = mock<Fn>();

when(() => fn(1)).thenReturn(2);

console.log(fn(1)); // 2
```

### Mocking promises

If you're mocking something that returns a promise then you'll be able to use the promise helpers to set the return value.

```typescript
type Fn = (x: number) => Promise<number>;

const fn = mock<Fn>();

when(() => fn(1)).thenResolve(2);

console.log(await fn()); // 2
```

### Throwing errors

```typescript
type Fn = (x: number) => void;
type FnWithPromise = (x: number) => Promise<void>;

const fn = mock<Fn>();
const fnWithPromise = mock<FnWithPromise>();

when(() => fn(1)).thenThrow();
when(() => fnWithPromise(1)).thenReject();
```

You'll notice there is no `never()` helper - if you expect a call to not be made simply don't set an expectation on it and the mock will throw if the call happens.

### Verifying expectations

Calling `verify(mock)` will make sure that all expectations set on `mock` have been met. If not, the function will throw an error and print the unmet expectations.

```typescript
const fn = mock<(x: number) => number>();

when(() => fn(1)).thenReturn(1).between(2, 10);

verify(fn); // throws
```

It will also throw if any unexpected calls happened that were maybe caught in the code under test.

```typescript
const fn = mock<() => void>();

try {
  fn(); // throws because the call is unexpected
} catch(e) {
  // your code might transition to an error state here
}

verify(fn); // throws
```

It is recommended that you call `verify()` on your mocks at the end of every test. This will make sure you don't have any unused expectations in your tests and that your code did not silently catch any of the errors that are thrown when an unexpected call happens. You can use `verifyAll()` to check all existing mocks e.g. in an `afterEach` hook.

![verify error](./media/verify.png)

### Resetting expectations

You can remove all expectations from a mock by using the `reset()` method:
                                                                        
```typescript
const fn = mock<(x: number) => number>();

when(() => fn(1)).thenReturn(1);

reset(fn);

fn(1); // throws
```

If you create common mocks that are shared by multiple tests you should reset them before using them e.g. in a `beforeEach` hook. You can use `resetAll()` to reset all existing mocks.

### Argument matchers

Sometimes you're not interested in specifying all the arguments in an expectation. Maybe they've been covered in another test, maybe they're hard to specify e.g. callbacks. In those cases you can use argument matchers to either ignore some arguments or use custom matchers to check them.

```typescript
const fn = mock<
  (x: number, data: { values: number[]; labels: string[] }) => string
>();

when(() => fn(
  It.isAny(),
  It.isObject({ values: [1, 2, 3] })
)).thenReturn('matched!');

console.log(fn(
  123, 
  { values: [1, 2, 3], labels: ['a', 'b', 'c'] })
); // 'matched!'
```

You can mix argument matchers with concrete arguments:

```typescript
when(() => fn(42, It.isObject())).thenReturn('matched');
```

Available matchers:
- `deepEquals` - the default, uses deep equality,
- `is` - uses `Object.is` for comparison,
- `isAny` - matches anything,
- `isNumber` - matches any number,
- `isString` - matches any string, can search for substrings and patterns,
- `isArray` - matches any array, can search for subsets,
- `isObject` - matches any object, can search for partial objects,
- `matches` - build your own matcher,
- `willCapture` - matches anything and stores the received value.

The following table illustrates the differences between the equality matchers:

| expected           | actual               | `It.is`   | `It.deepEquals` | `It.deepEquals({ strict: false })` |
|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| `"foo"`            | `"bar"`              | equal     | equal           | equal                              |
| `{ foo: "bar" }`   | `{ foo: "bar" }`     | not equal | equal           | equal                              |
| `{ }`              | `{ foo: undefined }` | not equal | not equal       | equal                              |
| `new (class {})()` | `new (class {})()`   | not equal | not equal       | equal                              |

Some matchers, like `isObject` and `isArray` support nesting matchers:

```typescript
It.isObject({ foo: It.isString() })

It.isArray([ It.isObject({
  foo: It.isString({ matching: /foo/ })
})])
```

You can create arbitrarily complex and type safe matchers with `It.matches(cb)`:

```typescript
const fn = mock<(x: number, y: number[]) => string>();

when(() => fn(
  It.matches(x => x > 0),
  It.matches(y => y.includes(42))
)).thenReturn('matched');
```

`It.willCapture` is a special matcher that will match any value and store it, so you can access it outside an expectation. This could be useful to capture a callback and then test it separately.

```ts
type Cb = (value: number) => number;

const fn = mock<(cb: Cb) => number>();

const matcher = It.willCapture<Cb>();
when(() => fn(matcher)).thenReturn(42);

console.log(fn(23, (x) => x + 1)); // 42
console.log(matcher.value?.(3)); // 4
```

### Mock options

#### Strictness

strong-mock has a few levels of "strictness" that control what values are returned when an unexpected property is accessed or an unexpected call is made. The strictness can be configured for each mock, or for all mocks with `setDefaults`.

```typescript
import { mock, when } from 'strong-mock';
import { Strictness } from './options';

type Foo = {
  bar: (value: number) => number;
}

// This is the default.
const strictFoo = mock<Foo>({
  strictness: Strictness.STRICT
});

// Accessing properties with no expectations is fine.
strictFoo.bar;
// Throws "Didn't expect bar(42) to be called".
strictFoo.bar(42);

const superStrictFoo = mock<Foo>({
  strictness: Strictness.SUPER_STRICT
});

// Throws "Didn't expect property bar to be accessed".
superStrictFoo.bar;
// Throws "Didn't expect property bar to be accessed".
superStrictFoo.bar(42);
```

#### Concrete matcher

You can set the matcher that will be used in expectations with concrete values e.g. `42` or `{ foo: "bar" }`. Passing in a [matcher argument](#argument-matchers) will always take priority.

```typescript
import { mock, when, It } from 'strong-mock';

// Use strict equality instead of deep equality.
const fn = mock<(x: number[]) => boolean>({
  concreteMatcher: It.is
});
when(() => fn([1, 2, 3])).thenReturn(true);

fn([1, 2, 3]); // throws because different arrays
```

#### Defaults

Mock options can be set for all mocks with `setDefaults`.

```typescript
import { mock, when, setDefaults, Strictness } from 'strong-mock';

setDefaults({
  strictness: Strictness.SUPER_STRICT
});

// Uses the new default.
const superStrictMock = mock<() => void>();
// Overrides the default.
const strictMock = mock<() => void>({ strictness: Strictness.STRICT });
```

## FAQ

### Why do I have to set all expectations first?

This library is different from other mocking/spying libraries you might have used before such as [sinon](https://sinonjs.org) or [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions). Whereas those libraries are focused on recording calls to the mocks and always returning something, strong-mock requires you to set your expectations upfront. If a call happens that is not expected the mock will throw an error.

This design decision has a few reasons behind it. First, it forces you to be aware of what your code needs from its dependencies. Spying libraries encourage checking those needs at the end of the test after the code has already called the mocks. This can lead to tests missing dependency calls that just happen to not throw any error at runtime with the dummy values that the spies return.

Secondly, it will highlight potential design problems such as violations of the SOLID principles. If you find yourself duplicating expectations between tests and passing dummy values to them because your test is not concerned with them then you might want to look into splitting the code to only depend on things it really needs.

### Can I partially mock an existing object/function?

No, passing a concrete implementation to `mock()` will be the same as passing a type: all properties will be mocked, and you have to set expectations on the ones that will be accessed.

### How do I set expectations on setters?

You currently can't do that. Please use a normal method instead e.g. `setFoo()` vs `set foo()`.

### Why do I have to set a return value even if it's `undefined`?

To make side effects explicit and to prevent future refactoring headaches. If you had just `when(() => fn())` and you later changed `fn()` to return a `number` then your expectation would become incorrect and the compiler couldn't check that for you.

### How do I provide a function for the mock to call?

There is no `thenCall()` method because it can't be safely typed - the type for `thenReturn()` is inferred from the return type in `when`, meaning that the required type would be the return value for the function, not the function itself. However, we can leverage this by setting an expectation on the function property instead:

```typescript
interface Foo {
  bar: (x: number) => string;
}

const foo = mock<Foo>();

when(() => foo.bar).thenReturn(x => `called ${x}`);

console.log(foo.bar(23)); // 'called 23'
```

The function in `thenReturn()` will be type checked against the actual interface, so you can make sure you're passing in an implementation that makes sense. Moreover, refactoring the interface will also refactor the expectation (in a capable IDE).

### Can I spread/enumerate a mock?

Yes, and you will only get the properties that have expectations on them.

```typescript
const foo = mock<{ bar: number; baz: number }>();
when(() => foo.bar).thenReturn(42);

console.log(Object.keys(foo)); // ['bar']

const foo2 = { ...foo };

console.log(foo2.bar); // 42
console.log(foo2.baz); // undefined
```

### How can I ignore `undefined` keys when setting expectations on objects?

Use the `It.deepEquals` matcher explicitly inside `when` and pass `{ strict: false }`:

```ts
const fn = mock<(x: { foo: string }) => boolean>();

when(() => fn(
  It.deepEquals({ foo: "bar" }, { strict: false }))
).thenReturn(true);

fn({ foo: "bar", baz: undefined }) === true
```

You can set this behavior to be the default by configuring the [concrete matcher](#concrete-matcher), and set it on all mocks using [setDefaults](#defaults):

```ts
setDefaults({
  concreteMatcher: (expected) => It.deepEquals(expected, { strict: false })
});
```
