## Features

- Type safe.
- Create mocks from class interfaces.
- Mocks are always strict.
- Useful error messages.


## Limitations

strong-mock mocks only class interfaces. If you need to mock concrete implementations with call forwarding, or you need to mock functions, then check other libraries like [typemoq](https://github.com/florinn/typemoq) or [ts-mockito](https://github.com/NagRock/ts-mockito).


## Requirements

strong-mock requires an environment that supports the [ES6 Proxy object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). This is necessary to create dynamic mocks from interfaces because TypeScript does not support reflection e.g. exposing the type info at runtime.


## Usage

### `Mock<T>()`

Creates a mock of type `<T>` that you can set expectations on using `when` and `returns`.

#### `.when`

Sets an expectation on the mock. If no expectations are set then this means the mock object should never be called. If it is called, then it will throw an error.

`.when` receives a callback that is passed a mock stub. Calling any methods on the stub, or accessing properties on it will set an expectation when followed by a `returns` call.

```typescript
import Mock from 'strong-mock';

interface Foo {
  bar(x: number): string;
}

const mock = new Mock<Foo>();

mock.when(f => f.bar(23)).returns('bar');
```

The above sets the following expectation:

```gherkin
Given a mock of type `Foo`
When someone calls its method `bar` with arguments `23`
Then the mock will return `bar`.
```

#### `.returns`

Set the return value for the chained expectation. MUST always be called after `.when` in order to set the expectation.

```typescript
mock.when(f => f.bar(23)).returns('bar'); // sets the expectation

mock.when(f => f.bar(23)); // does nothing
```

### `.stub`

Gets a stub that you can pass into code expecting the real thing.

```typescript
console.log(mock.stub.bar(23)); // 'bar'
console.log(mock.stub.bar(24)); // throws error
```

#### `.verifyAll`

Verifies that all set expectations have been met. If not, it will throw an error with details about the first unmet expectation.

```typescript
mock.when(f => f.bar(1)).returns('bar');
mock.when(f => f.bar(2)).returns('baz');

mock.stub.bar(1);

mock.verifyAll(); // will throw because `bar(2)` hasn't been called
```
